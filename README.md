# iob-nesctrl - Nintendo NES controllers physical interface

Physical interface for 2 Nintendo NES controllers, as long as they contain an HEF4021B chip or a functionally equivalent
one as main component.

## Discontinued. No longer "iob-nesctrl" and it's outdated here. See the final version at https://github.com/Edw590/iob-soc-pong, where it is local and just called NESCTRL.
